## INTRODUCTION

   Welcome to the University of Ghana's Department of Computer Science website's official repository. This project offers a full web solution I created utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to improve the department's online presence. This ten-page website seeks to serve as an informative hub for students, professors, and visitors as a dynamic and engaging platform.

## PURPOSE

 The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly and visually appealing digital area for the University of Ghana's Department of Computer Science. The website provides crucial information about the department's programs, academic calendar, faculty profiles, and research objectives through properly built HTML structures, responsive CSS layouts, and interactive JavaScript features.

### LESSON LEARNED

Throughout the development of the project, I have learned when building a website, I discovered the value of structuring and commenting my code. It may appear to be a little detail, but taking the time to cleanly structure my code and add comments throughout makes it much easier to comprehend and maintain. It is also useful when collaborating with others or returning to the project later. I can save myself a lot of time and grief in the long run by keeping the code tidy and providing comments to clarify its purpose.
