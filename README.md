## INTRODUCTION

   Welcome to the official repository for the University of Ghana Department of Computer Science website. This project represents a comprehensive web solution I developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance the online presence of the department. As a dynamic and engaging platform, this ten-paged website aims to serve as an informative hub for students, faculty, and visitors.

## PURPOSE

 The purpose of this project is to provide a user-friendly and visually appealing digital space for the Department of Computer Science at the University of Ghana. Through carefully crafted HTML structures, responsive CSS layouts, and interactive JavaScript elements, the website delivers essential information about the department's programs, academic calendar, faculty profiles, and researchÂ initiatives
